# Session 0 — 2026-02-11

*Project: PipeForge*
*Compression: HIGH*

## Summary

Conceived and scaffolded PipeForge: a local C# pipeline engine with native step-debugging via Visual Studio. Full solution created, compiled successfully after minor fix. ADEIS analysis completed (3 DERIVE passes, converged). Critical 5 improvements identified and prioritized. Prometheus campaign initialized for Claude Code execution.

## Outcomes

- Full C# solution scaffolded (PipeForge.Core + PipeForge.Runner + PipeForge.Tests)
- PipelineEngine, PipelineRun, StepResult, PipelineLoader, PipelineWatcher, PipelineTemplates all implemented
- 4 template building blocks: InnoSetup, DotNet, Security, TwinCAT
- CLI with run/init/templates commands + interactive mode
- Example YAML pipelines + README
- Solution compiles after Environment.NewLine fix
- GitHub repo created: https://github.com/holbizmetrics/PipeForge
- ADEIS analysis: 3 DERIVE passes, INHABIT validation, GenFlight check
- Critical 5 identified and prioritized
- Avalonia GUI architecture proposed (PipeForge.GUI consuming PipeForge.Core)
- Prometheus campaign state drafted for Claude Code handoff

## Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| C# / .NET 8 | Enterprise quality + free step-debugging via VS debugger |
| Core + Runner split | Engine reusable; GUI = second frontend to same library |
| YAML for pipeline definitions | Familiar to GitLab/GitHub/Azure users |
| System.CommandLine for CLI | Modern .NET CLI framework, subcommands, help generation |
| YamlDotNet for parsing | Standard .NET YAML library |
| Templates as C# code, not YAML files | Composable via Compose(), type-safe, IDE support |
| Prometheus campaign for Claude Code | Strategic planning here, execution there |

## Open Items

- [ ] Push scaffold to GitHub
- [ ] Runtime-test against real InnoSetup project
- [ ] Execute Critical 5 (T-001 through T-005)

## Next Session

Claude Code picks up campaign from .prometheus/ files. First action: T-001 (self-documenting YAML templates).

## Learning

- Worked: ADEIS DERIVE producing actionable findings (3 passes converged)
- Worked: INHABIT identifying real friction points (bare YAML, opaque errors, silent completion)
- Worked: Planning/execution split between claude.ai and Claude Code
